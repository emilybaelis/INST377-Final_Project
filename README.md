Developer Manual (bottom half of your README.md)
- The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.
- They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
- You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.


## Developer Manual
- How to install your application and all dependencies
- How to run your application on a server
- How to run any tests you have written for your software
- The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PATCH, etc endpoints, and what they each do
- A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
